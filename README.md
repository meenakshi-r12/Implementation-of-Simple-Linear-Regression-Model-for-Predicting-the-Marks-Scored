# Implementation-of-Simple-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Predicting-the-Marks-Scored

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the marks scored by a student using the simple linear regression model.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm

## Program:

Program to implement the simple linear regression model for predicting the marks scored.
Developed by: 
RegisterNumber:
```
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error
df=pd.read_csv('student_scores.csv')
#displaying the content in datfile
df.head()
df.tail()
```
## Output:

## Result:

Thus the program to implement the simple linear regression model for predicting the marks scored is written and verified using python programming.
